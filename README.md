react-shop is a small pet-project store with authorization functionality, API request, product browsing and filtering, adding products to the cart and the ability to create product orders.

API from https://dummyjson.com/ was used for the project. An API was used from this site to retrieve array products and request authorization. The product filter also works with a request.

If you want to run this project locally, you should:

1. download the project
2. In the terminal project, run the command "npm install"
3. run the project with "npm run dev"

As I wrote before, this project has authorization, that is, you should send any username and password of the user from https://dummyjson.com/users, for example:

username: kminchelle

password 0leplR

or something else.
